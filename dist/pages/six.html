            David is a hydrologist with a particular affinity for music.
            <br><br>
            In 2023 he decided to go on a world tour merging both of his passions. He hopped from city to city using his music industry connections to hitchhike with different bands and artists. At each city he gathered river water samples and had them shipped back to his lab to study.
            <br><br>
            David's journey started in the early morning of New Year’s Day. He lucked out, and a New Years special usually annually broadcast from Times Square was moved this year due to unknown reasons right to his city. He had a blast, caught the artist who headlined after the show, and hitched a ride on their private jet down south to the headliner’s hometown. He made sure to catch the headliner’s show once they landed then went about exploring and collecting river samples.
            <br><br>
            A month passed before David saw another show. He once again met up with the group after the show and jumped on their plane, catching their next show 3 days later in a new city. While this new city didn’t exactly have a major river, David still found a way to get around by boat in his free time.
            <br><br>
            It was a little over a month before David caught his next band. He was able to snag a concert for cheap and catch a ride with them onto the next city en route to a famous music festival 2 days later.
            <br><br>
            David once again hung around for around a month in his new city, soaking in the sun. The next artist he caught was holding an outdoor concert in the park. After the concert David followed him, making a relatively short trip to the next venue. The artist liked David’s company, and asked him to stay on the tour for the next stop, which happened to be the artist’s home town. David politely declined.
            <br><br>
            Towards the beginning of the next month, David went to another major concert. The arena venue was intimidating, but David was unphased and still managed to convince the artist to let him hitchhike on the tour. David was fairly convincing, as he not only stayed with this artist for the first stop, but rather for the entire month, for a total of 11 concerts. What a rush! 
            <br><br>
            David didn’t mind staying in this new city for a while. After all, it was the biggest one he’d been to so far, there was plenty to see. However, he eventually did catch another artist, on their self proclaimed “Final Tour.” After the show he once again met up with the band and followed them Northeast up to their next stop.
            <br><br>
            David was in a big time concert kind of mood. There were a couple of artists he was interested in, and he settled on the second day of the first two-day concert at the main indoor arena in the city. Like clockwork, David once again befriended the musicians, and he was on his way north once more.
            <br><br>
            David felt homesick, and he figured the best remedy for that would be some good old country music. Lucky for him, the music festival luck fell in his favor. He singled out the headliner of day 2, and followed him back south for his next show. 
            <br><br>
            For whatever reason, David felt like he needed to switch things up. He clearly hadn’t done enough yet. He wanted to follow a band across the world, so he waited until the last day of the month after he arrived, biding his time. There was a festival that day, and one of the bands playing it had plans to go overseas for their next concert. David was all in.
            <br><br>
            After traveling across the world, David was surprised to find some familiar faces after he arrived. One of the bands he had previously hitchhiked with just happened to be in this new city. David made haste, grabbed his water sample, and jumped on the plane with his old travel mates to their next destination.
            <br><br>
            Somehow David found himself at an iconic spot for music (though in a genre he had yet to listen to thus far). Instead of remedying that disservice, David continued on his concert going ways. Roughly 3 weeks after his first concert in this new city, David caught another artist. He was convinced that the name of the venue he saw her at must have reminded her of a landmark from her youth. He made sure to bring it up to her when he spoke with her. It must have worked, as he was able to hitchhike with her to her next destination.
            <br><br>
            Now in the final month of the year, David figured he was ready for one final trip. He settled on a 3 person act a little over a week into the month, at a venue by the train tracks near the docks. He did his normal song and dance, convincing the two members that were continuing onwards together to let him tag along. They obliged, and David was off to his final city.
            <br><br>
            While in the final city, David found a planned lake where he figured a river ought to be. Unfettered, he went to the river instead of the lake to collect his sample. A great year came to a close, and David got on the plane back home, this time without a concert (he was exhausted).
            <br><br>
            Back home, David recounted his memories of his incredible trip while looking at his water samples from the various rivers he saw along the way. To his dismay, David discovered that he miswrote the label on his final sample and included an extra “o” after a couple of consonants.
