                            For this one, fill in the numbers 1 through 9, using each only once, to make all of the vertical and horizontal equations correct. Then combine the 3 numbers solution in each empty cell in each row to make up a 3 digit number then add each of the 3 3 digit numbers and subtract 1799 by that number to get the final answer.

                            The musical function f(x) represents the sound intensity level in decibels and is defined by the formula  f ( x ) = x^3 − x^2 − x − (11/4)    , graphed on a time-intensity graph. If  k k is a constant representing a specific decibel level such that the equation  f ( x ) = k corresponds to three different moments during a song, find the value of  k. Given k, the pitch  P at those moments can be calculated using  P = k + 79. What is the value of P?
